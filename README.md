# Food Menu Project by Zach Riane Machacon

## Context
This personal project is a practice regarding the concepts of linked lists. This is in line with the current course that I'm taking
which is Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Goals
1. Create a linked list of possible combo food to be added to a meal along with a main food product.
2. Items can only be edited with successful password entry.
3. Should output order made, and total price of order.
4. Ask for cash paid, and check if money given is enough for a max of 3 tries.
